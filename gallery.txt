TASK 1
-How many ports are open?
Use nmap to find out


What's the name of the CMS?
Use Go buster to discover hidden directory /gallery

GOBUSTER dir -u <ip address> -w /usr/shr/wordlist/dirbuster/wordlist-2.3...

Gallery directory requires login.php to login, a username and password text box is provided.
Since the extension for the url is php, it is likely to be using a sql database so we can try SQL injection to by pass login.

' OR 1=1 -- '

Alternatively we could have first look on exploit db for known vulnerability for simple image gallery system which would show that it is susceptible to SQL INJECTION

After we login we discovered that a file upload is possible in the gallery system.
So we try to upload a php reverse shell script into the server and set up a nc listener to receive the reverse shell.

QN:What's the hash password of the admin user?


FINDING MYSQl LOGIN CREDENTIALS
Navigate to /var/www/html/gallery 
In the directory we find initialise.php file, inside is the login credentials to the mysql db

Before we login to my sql db. We have a dumb shell, we need to upgrade to a interactive shell to access mysql.

Most linux system has python installed by default.
We can check if there is python installed using
Which python
Which python2
Which python3
Or python 3 --version

Since python is install we can use python to upgrade into an interactive shell!
Run 3 commands to Upgrade shell

1. Python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

-c means execute command in python
-Import pty adds module for controlling terminal
-Pty.spawn Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current process’s standard io
-/bin (binary) / bash( bash, the "Bourne Again Shell")

2. EXPORT TERM=xterm

command sets the terminal emulator to xterm


3. Stty raw -echo; fg

stty — set the options for a terminal device interface
raw (-raw) If set, change the modes of the terminal so that no input or. output processing is performed
-echo When you disable it, your typing is not echoed back to you, which is why it seems as if the terminal is hanging
-FG a command that moves a background process on your current Linux shell to the foreground

Next step is to login and enumerate mysql
Mysql -u username -p

Then show databases;

If no ; is used to end statement it continues to break out of it type \g and enter

Show tables to find tables

Finally Select * from users


QN: What's the user flag?
This is solved by finding mike's password in a log file in /var/log/mike_back_Up through Manuel enumeration or linpeas


TASK 2 GAIN ROOT

Switch users from www-data( default ubuntu user) to mike

Su mike
Enter mike's passwd

Sudo -l

Leads to a file that allows mike to run nano as root

USE GTFO BIN to see how to SU with nano

Run the rootkit.sh to escalate privilege 

Look for root flag and cat it
